/**
 * The centralized notification service, aka the central routing point for all
 * broadcast notifications. You use it by registering interceptors and
 * subscribers, and handling any messages that are sent().
 *
 * Interceptors are intended to be both filters and decorators, where
 * individual components can handle messages before either terminating
 * the dispatch chain, or passing them on to the next interceptor. In this
 * fashion it is easy to handle specific messages in one context while
 * other messages in another.
 *
 * Subscribers are processors that handle all messages vetted by our
 * interceptors.
