            <h2>Stories</h2>

            <p>It all begins with a <strong>story</strong>. A story is a
                bug report or proposed feature. Stories are then further
                split into <strong>tasks</strong>, which affect a given
                project and branch. You can easily track backports of
                bugs to a specific branch, or plan cross-project
                features.</p>

            <h2>Projects</h2>

            <p>StoryBoard lets you efficiently track your work across a
                large number of interrelated projects. Flexible
                <strong>project groups</strong> lets you get the views
                that makes the most sense to you.</p>

            <h2>But why?</h2>
            <p>The OpenStack project has run into a number of limitations
	        with existing tools; in particular, the workflow needed by
	        a highly-distributed system that spans multiple projects
	        is not well served.  This system uses the best concepts
	        from existing tools and goes beyond to support the needs
	        of the OpenStack project.</p>
